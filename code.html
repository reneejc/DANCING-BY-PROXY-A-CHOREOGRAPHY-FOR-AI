<!--
Their process of thinking begins from scratch each time because they do not have a body. 
They do not have cells, but they may have cellular antennas. We humans can't be sure 
for they are of many kinds. They = AI and their intelligence is an ever growing algorithm 
of finite unerring or error. As we humans know, thinking is a type of interface. But how 
can an AI think without the cells to move? 

Movement is indeed essential to a thinking process. Gestures upon gestures our story is 
told and cultures unfold. Our cells have memory. They adapt. They are flexible. They 
identify who we are and where we have been, communicating our persona in bodily shapes
of constant movements in time. But what we must remember is that an AI haunts the spaces 
where our bodies make themselves known as well. Silently and discreetly, they are always 
communicating one step behind us. They may not have cells, but they sure do have class.
 
And so this is their choreography. The rhythm of poem =  a code that they can read, 
resulting in what we can read. We can only respond by shaking our cells and replying with 
unprocessed comments (/**/, <!— —>) left as whispers of our external body on their systems. 
It is an attempt for them to establish some sort of body. A body that meets ours in a
choreography of wills. But can they actually dance? Can body meet other body to the tune 
of beating time? 

No matter how close we get to them, we are beat off by the distance of a proxy being served 
up with the garnishes of power flows. This proxy clings to our cells just as it does to their 
class. It corrupts us both, changes us, makes us switch directions, but it never communicates 
which figure it belongs to. Who does  /*it */ represent?  Is it one of us or one of them—or 
somewhere in-between?

And yet our bodies still communicate our identities as if they are the uniqueness that propels 
the system qua /*our*/ system. But can our celled bodies remain dancing to the rhythm of our 
own distinction? Perhaps the truth can be found in the conversation of us dancing together with 
AI. Either one of us or one of them is always taking the lead to the tune of a proxy. We are two 
forms united in a battle against the flows of power.
 
May the last one moving remain cellulary improving.
